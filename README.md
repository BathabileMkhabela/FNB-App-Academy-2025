# FNB App Academy 2025 Projects 🚀

Welcome to my collection of projects developed during the FNB App Academy 2025 program.  
This repository showcases the skills I learned and applied while building applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and APIs.

## 📚 What I Learned
Frontend Development: Building responsive and interactive user interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.    
APIs:  
  - Consuming external APIs to fetch and display dynamic data.  
  - Creating my own REST APIs to provide data and services.  
Version Control with Git & GitHub: Managing code, collaborating, and pushing projects to the cloud.
